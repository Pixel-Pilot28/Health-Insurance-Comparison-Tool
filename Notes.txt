Bugs
	If you input all your data, and then switch to a different tab and switch back to the data input tab, all the data are lost.

Ideas
	For the data input where the dates auto fil, is it possible to have the visit information collapsed to take up less space, while still allowing the user to click-to-expand the hierarchy when they want to input data?

	Only show the top ten cheapest plans in the compare graphs. Can show all the plans in a table though 

	Allow users to toggle hypothetical changes, such as increasing service usage or adding unexpected healthcare events (e.g., an emergency visit).

	All preventive care is free, before and after the deductible, for HDHP's. This includes annual physicals, well-child visits, immunizations, mammograms, and more.
